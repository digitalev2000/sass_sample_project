# SASS Sample Project

This is a fully functional SASS based project and all of the SASS files can be viewed inside the _sass folder. If the project is downloaded and ran with Compass you can see that the SASS compiles to the theme.css file. If there is a way you would like to enhance the project by editing the variables/scss please feel free to do so and make any suggestions.
